A little PyQt5 app to teach how instances work in Object Oriented Programming.

## Requirements
* Python 3
* PyQt5

In Debian-based Linux distributions, run
```bash
sudo apt install python3-pyqt5
```
or download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), which has a default installation of PyQt5.
Anaconda works on other operative systems too.

Alternatively, create a virtual environment and install from [pypi](https://pypi.org/):
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install PyQt5
```

## Usage
Execute `main.py`, which opens one instance of the application.

You can see and execute `start_lecture.py` for other uses.

If working in a virtual environment, ensure it is activated first.
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 start_lecture.py
```
